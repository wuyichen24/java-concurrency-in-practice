/**
 * ConcurrentPuzzleSolver
 * 
 * @list 8.16
 * @smell Good
 * @author Brian Goetz and Tim Peierls
 * 
 * <p>A concurrent solver for the puzzle framework by:
 *    - Evaluating the set of possible next positions
 *    - Pruning positions already searched
 *    - Evaluating whether success has yet been achieved (by this task or by some other task)
 *    - Submitting unsearched positions to an Executor
 *    
 * <p>ConcurrentPuzzleSolver uses the internal work queue of the thread pool instead of the call stack to hold the state of the search.
 * 
 * <p>Drawback: This does not deal well with the case where there is no solution.
