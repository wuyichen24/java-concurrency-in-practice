 * @smell Bad
 * @author Brian Goetz and Tim Peierls
 * 
 * <p>The bad example of an attempt at running an arbitrary Runnable for a given amount of time.
 * 
 * <p>Problem: Since timedRun can be called from an arbitrary thread, it cannot know the calling thread's interruption policy. 
 * If the task completes before the timeout, the cancellation task that interrupts the thread in which timedRun was called could 
 * go off after timedRun has returned to its caller. We don't know what code will be running when that happens.
