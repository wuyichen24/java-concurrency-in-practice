/**
 * LogWriter
 * 
 * @list 7.13
 * @smell Bad
 * @author Brian Goetz and Tim Peierls
 * 
 * <p>A simple logging service in which the logging activity is moved to a separate logger thread.
 * 
 * <p>Drawback: This log writer can not be shutdown because of canceling a producer-consumer activity requires canceling both the producers and the consumers. 
 *              But because the producers in this case are not dedicated threads, canceling them is harder.
