 * <p>Code that would deadlock if intrinsic locks were not reentrant.
 * 
 * <p>If intrinsic locks were not reentrant, the call to super.doSomething() 
 * would never be able to acquire the lock because it would be considered 
 * already held, and the thread would permanently stall waiting for a lock it 
 * can never acquire.
